## Description

The problem: The freshman fifteen! So many students enter and go through college feeling too ashamed to go to the gym alone or feeling afraid to go on a run alone because of safety concerns.

The solution: The Fitness Finder application allows students to log in to the application and create a profile which specifies things like their gender, interests (e.g. strength training, running, outdoors), level (e.g. just starting, intermediate), “looking for” (e.g. a mentor to help me improve, a friend to keep me company while running, spotter/gym buddy), and goals (e.g. run an 8 minute mile, squat 200 lbs, hike Stairway to Heaven). The app would pair the user with someone with matching/similar interests.

Advanced implementation would also include the ability to document meetups (for safety or progress tracking), upload photos for each completed outing, and a feed where users can see the completed meetups/workouts their friends/matched users have done.

Notes on privacy and safety: Users can only sign up if they are current UH students. The website would also warn users when setting up a meeting with a matched user to meet in advance in a public place, like the gym. In the “Beyond the Basics” section I go into detail on a scheduling/progress tracking feature that would allow users to document every single meeting, which should deter other users with dubious intentions.
