## Overview

The problem: The freshman fifteen! So many students enter and go through college feeling too ashamed to go to the gym alone or feeling afraid to go on a run alone because of safety concerns.

The solution: Manoa Fitness Finder allows students to log in and create a profile which allows them to set their: age, upload an image, a brief description, gender, interests (e.g. Running, Lifting, Acrobatics, Calisthenics, Walking, Hiking, and Climbing), level (e.g. beginner, intermediate, or advanced), seeking (e.g. Gym Buddy, Mentor, Mentee, or no Preference), and goals (e.g. run an 8 minute mile, squat 200 lbs, hike Stairway to Heaven). The app would pair the user with someone with matching/similar interests.

After creating a profile you can create an event that you are intending to go on and want others to join, or sign-up for an event that someone else has posted. You can add people to your friends list after browsing the list of other users. 

Advanced implementation would also include the ability to document meetups (for safety or progress tracking), upload photos for each completed outing, and a feed where users can see the completed meetups/workouts their friends/matched users have done.

Notes on privacy and safety: The website would also warn users when setting up a meeting with a matched user to meet in advance in a public place, like the gym.

Website design is my passion. Growing up on my father's Javascript farm gave me a lifelong love of creating websites and an appreciation of the development skills required. It's become my dream to create the best Meteor app React designed intellij developed website for finding fitness partners in the Manoa area.

I'm currently a Junior at UH Manoa, studying to get my BS in Computer Science. I have some experience in designing websites using a website developer, nothing like what we are learning in class. I am excited to take what I learned while working on this project and apply it to the website I am currently designing for work.
